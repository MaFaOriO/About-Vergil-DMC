        <h3 class="Boxes-Title">Introduction</h3>

        <div class="boxes-text">Devil may cry 5 special edition is the coolest game ever made! You heard right the original factually proven by 
            scientists, coolest game ever made has been dethroned by the simple addition of just two words, but how did it pull 
            off such an impressive if not completely obvious achievement well? It's simple, really, they just made Vergil a playable 
            character. Who's Vergil I hear you ask foolishly is this Vergil no that's not Vergil Vergil is the coolest character probably in
            video games. He's dante's identical twin brother, and I use the term identical loosely because they look nothing alike in this game, 
            which is odd because in DMC 3 Vergil is just Dante's character model but with slicked back hair, and I use the term slicked back loosely because
            he's rocking this super saiyan 2 spiky hairdo, but in the cut scenes when he makes his  hair do this he does that classic slicked back motion like 
            some sort of 1960s greaser. So... I guess, I'm just going to go with slicked back but like anime slicked back, maybe it's because Dante's face model in 
            DMC 5 is just so handsome, that having two of them in the same game would be pushing that M rating if you know what I mean.
            This video is just going to be me gushing over, why Vergil is so cool and how many times, I can say his name before it starts to get
            annoying. For those of you, who are unfamiliar with Vergil, but got DMC 5 because it looked cool. You might be questioning me and thinking is Vergil 
            really that cool, I mean he appeared at the end of the game and just kind of kicked my ass a bit, and he looked cool kind of I guess, but coolest in the 
            whole game? Even cooler than Dante? (I'm not so sure). Cooler than Dante? (Fuck you!). Cooler than Dante? (Suck a dick!). Cooler than Dante? (Eat my ass!). 
            To really slam it heavily into your face with great force!

            <h3 class="Boxes-Title">Combat</h3>

            <div class="boxes-text">Like the rest of DMC 5, the combat is what makes the game cooler than any other game so much, so that other games are starting to just
                flat out copy it final fantasy 16. Is pretty much the same thing in terms of animations, this attack looks like Nero's devil bringer 
                this is an actual enemy step black smoke cloud and everything DMC 5's combat is astounding and playing as Vergil is so much fun!
                It brings the game's combat from like a 14 to a 21. The most important thing to note is that Vergil can teleport and I don't know 
                about you, but I'm a huge sucker for teleportation. I know that Dante teleports too with his tricky dicky style, but when you compare this
                to this Vergil just looks way better. It also goes farther, which makes it more of a teleport instead of doing a flip with the double jump,
                like Dante and Nero, Vergil just flips anyway, because everyone knows flips are cool, and instead uses a teleport as his
                double jump, Vergil can also use these quick dodge-like teleports to, uh dodge which instantly makes him go up, about seven points on the cool.

            <h3 class="Boxes-Title">Weapons</h3>

            <div class="boxes-text">I'm just going to talk about Vergil's weapons and his attacks to really prove, just how cool Vergil. Really is when it comes to vergil's actual attacks and
               weapon selection Vergil is in my opinion the most fun version of the game's combat, it's cool to string together long
               intricate combos with Nero, and his double breakers and getting a perfect x act, it feels amazing pulling off perfectly
               timed royal guards as Dante, and combining as many different weapons to create these absurdly long combos
               v is fun too. If you're into that sort of thing the more laid-back approach, but Vergil is different, than the others Vergil's combat is all about speed 
               precision and power! Like I said before, the thing I love most about Vergil, is that he can teleport but aside from his short dodge like
               teleports and his directional air teleports he can lock onto an enemy shoot a sword at them, and just teleport over to them in a flash!
               Dante can also do that, but Vergil's is just better. The best way I can put it into words, is Dante's teleport feels like a wave, he kind of
               appears at the enemy and then, he hangs there for a bit before following up, and if the enemy is far away Dante has to teleport
               multiple times before he can get to the enemy's location. Vergil is just there instantly and there's pretty much no hang time well, for the 
               most part, except for shit like this. I also think it's really cool, how when you teleport to an enemy, if they're far away, you can see Vergil's
               after image skipping behind him trying to catch up to him, because he just moves so fast! Vergil's main weapon is
               his yamato and he can use it to slice through enemies at lightning speeds, leaving a trail of lingering cuts behind
               him like you see in all those anime. You know the ones, I'm talking about like Dante, Nero. Vergil's yamato comes with a plethora of combos 
               from air combos, paws combos air, paws combos launch attacks, launch attack, follow-ups you name it it's all here! You can also block attacks.

            <h3 class="Boxes-Title">Devil trigger</h3>

            <div class="boxes-text">Vergil (I said I was going to use his name a lot), Vergil like his twin brother Dante
                also has a devil trigger and a sin devil trigger, which are also amazing to use and fun!
                His devil trigger summons a doppelganger, which attacks with you and dances and to send devil trigger               
                makes his attacks more powerful, and it extends his combos making the finishing blow  much stronger and providingr 
                more knock back to continue your combos! Vergil's sin devil trigger is pretty much just get a get out of jail free card, like look what happens when 
                I'm fighting artemis and I activate sin devil trigger and just spam rapid slash!

            <h3 class="Boxes-Title">Spectacularity</h3>

            <div class="boxes-text">When somebody's playing smash brothers at a high level versus, you know just playing with your buddies at a party,
                and Devil may cry 5. When you don't know what you're doing it's really easy to look dumb, like when you watch me play
                for instance I fucking suck at this game, but Vergil looks cool! No matter what you do every move, he
                makes and every step he takes just looks amazing! He looks cool by default
                you don't even gotta try, but for more advanced players who know what they're doing he looks 
                even cooler! I love the amount of care that went into adding Vergil to the game. He's not just like a quick add-on capcom
                knows that fans of the series want to go crazy with Vergil, his animations look so incredible, his
                lightning-fast movements look so powerful, the lingering glow that comes out of each swing of his yamato
                lights up, his character model the sound effects, that accompany his moves ring out through your entire body,
                it's like chewing five gum. His taunts are also great! There's one where he spins a
                summon sword on his finger, there is one where he pulls out v's book and starts reading it, there is one where
                he turns the yamato back into Nero's devil bringer arm from dmc 4, and those
                are just to name a few there's plenty more that just look so cool and when you have your doppelganger out, he dances with you.
                Which is like come on like who thinks of that is fucking awesome, and for me personally with Vergil's
                portion of the game. I'm really glad they only added a couple new cutscenes, because I don't need to know the story of why
                Vergil is now playable. I just want to play as him. I don't really give a shit, show me the beginning, when he encounters
                Nero and then let me play through the game, without doing all the bullshit, and then have cut scenes at the end, where he's fighting
                Dante that's what I want to see and that's what they gave us! So it's like they read our collective minds!
